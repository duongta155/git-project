What is your favorite movie?

Parasite

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

Mexcio

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

Immortal super power. I believe that humans' cycle of life is really short, so extending that cycle can help me enjoy my life. I can visit places and eat food.
